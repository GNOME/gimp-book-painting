# Dry Media and around

One of aspects more beautiful of dry medias, is the mixing and cover-up ability. With a simple brush is possible simulate fine a dry media stroke, but not the mixing/blending. For this, is necessary a paint dynamic with some impasto or blending qualities. I see, only the effective blend between the strokes and not only as an ‘sfumino’ technique … then, is useful understand this behavior through others ways, for instance, how the blend modes applied directly on paint tools helping the paint dynamics solve in elegant way.

Is possible emulate the blending with blend filter directly on brush with Mode. I prefer in these cases the ‘Darken Only’, mainly the stains with successive passages are not darken.
Ink medias (china ink pen, rapidograph pen, felt-tip, markers)

The strokes or typical stains of these tools are very dependent of the canvas support: smooth, rough, glossy, matte, textured, absorbent or not, etc …
For the Ink medias, normally we have the paper as support. Imagine an old ink pen on a smooth and glossy paper … the stroke is thin and precise but can drool in the curves or on the direction’s change.
Another case is could be, always, an old ink pen but with a rough paper and absorbent (watercolor paper, for instance), the stroke line can be imprecise with noise along strokes and paths.
For each of these cases, ideally, is not possible have a unique paint dynamic, but two. Perhaps, is possible to build an unique paint dynamic but with different brushes, and in this case only raster brushes, mainly the .gih brushes (animated brushes) are capable to emulate these characteristics.
